# Lease Gen Manual
### What is Lease Gen?  
Lease Gen is the result of Bryce, an annoyed person who hates Microsoft's mailing list function in Word.    

### How does Lease Gen Work?  
Lease Gen takes data entered from the UI (User Interface) and creates a PDF using lease templates which can then be sent as is or be printed out. Office to office leases should be the same unless it requires a special addendum such as for parking, garages, lead paint (Dupont), etc. For some leases these items only need to be made once for the inital move in and will not be necessary for the remainder of the tenants stay.

### How Do I Install Lease Gen?
Please follow the below steps:
1. Download the latest EXE from the release catagory on the right
2. Run the installer clicking continue or yes when necessary (If a warning about security appears please ignore by clicking "More Info" than "Run Anyway")
3. The installer should now be finished and can be removed. A desktop Icon should now be visable on screen.

NOTE: All data files for Lease Gen can be found at "C:\Program Files\Lease Gen"

### How Do I Uninstall Lease Gen?
Please follow the below steps:  
1. Click the windows key on your keyboard
2. Type in "Lease"
3. On the right hand side it should say Uninstall, Click that and "Programs and Features" should open
4. Find Lease Gen
5. Right click or double click and Uninstall
6. Click yes and Ok on the prompts and your done.

### How Do I Use Lease Gen?
NOTE: Due to Lease Gen being in constant development, all options are subject to change after each new version.   
Please follow the below steps:  
1. Open Lease Gen
2. Fill in all blank spaces
3. If no data is entered for Pets, the addendum will be removed from the template
4. Finish by clicking 'Submit' this will make a PDF located on your desktop

### What Do I Do If A Lease Does Not Generate?
Stay calm, If this happens try closing Lease Gen and relaunching. Proceed to fill in all data then click the center of the submit button (This has been a problem in the past).

If this does not fix your issue please try restarting your PC.

If the above Items do not work please follow [How Do I Uninstall Lease Gen](#how-do-i-uninstall-lease-gen)

### What If I Need To Make Changes To The Templates Or Properties?
If in the future I (Bryce) no longer work with the company, you can reach me via email 'brycelogue@gmail.com' and i will do my best to make the app support your needed changes.  

Hopefully I think ahead of time and add in the ability to edit the Properties, Offices and Lease data. Or Lease generation is switched over the the managment program.
