        {{SecurityDeposit}} receipt of which is acknowledged by Landlord, as security for the faith and
        performance by the Tenant for the terms hereof, to be returned to Tenant on the full and faithful

    <p>If the Tenant fulfills all other provisions of this Lease, this security deposit shall be used for any
        outstanding account balance and any damages sustained by the Landlord by reason of the negligence of the Tenant,
        insofar as cleaning, maintenance and repair of said apartment is concerned, the remainder of said deposit shall
        be refunded to Tenant, provided further that Tenant’s liability to Landlord for damages sustained by reason of
        his negligence shall not be limited to the amount of security deposited hereunder. <b>Nicotine stains and odor
            due to cigarette smoke are not considered normal wear and tear and associated charges shall be deducted from
            the security deposit. Stains and odors from the lingering effects of cooking are not considered normal wear
            and tear and associated charges shall be deducted from the security deposit.</b></p>
    <p>It is strongly recommended that Tenant be present during the post move-out inspection by Landlord. If Tenant
        elects not to be present, then he/she accepts Landlord’s analysis of the situation and accepts the related
        charges.</p>
    <p><b>2. NUMBER OF OCCUPANTS.</b> Tenant agrees that the Leased apartment shall be occupied by no more than
        <b>{{TotalOccupants}}</b> persons, consisting of <b>{{TotalAdults}}</b> adults and <b>{{TotalChildren}}</b>

        <b>{{LeaseHolders}}, {{Occupants}}</b>.</p>
    <p>Should any other person wish to stay in the apartment over 14 days, then it is required that an Occupancy
        Application be submitted for that person and reviewed by Property Manager and/or Landlord prior to occupancy to
        see if occupancy by that person will be permitted. Failure to submit an Occupancy Application is a breach of
        this Apartment Lease and is grounds for Termination of this Lease under paragraph <b>16. DEFAULT</b> below for
        failure
        to comply with a provision of this Apartment Lease.</p>
    <p><b>3. ASSIGNMENT AND SUBLETTING.</b> Without the prior written consent of the Landlord, Tenant shall not assign
        this Lease, or sublet the premises of any part thereof. Consent by the Landlord to one assignment of subletting

        necessary to make repairs and alterations of the apartment or the apartment building, or to clean the apartment.
        Landlord shall be allowed to take all material into and upon the Premises that may be required thereof without
        the same constituting an eviction of Tenant in whole or in part. If Tenant is not personally present to open and
        permit an entry into the Premises, at any time, when for any reason an entry therein shall be necessary or
        permissible, to the extent permitted by law Landlord or Landlord's agents may enter the Premises by a master
        key, or in the event of any emergency, may forcibly enter the Premises, without rendering Landlord or such
        agents liable thereof (if during such entry Landlord or Landlord's agents shall accord reasonable care to
        Tenant's property) and without in any manner affecting the obligations and covenants of the Lease.</p>
    <p><b>6. UTILITIES.</b> Electricity, gas, telephone, internet service and other utilities are not furnished as a
        part of this Lease unless otherwise indicated herein. Such expenses are the responsibility of and shall be
        maintained at the expense of the Tenant. <b><u>{{Utilities}}</u></b> charges furnished to the apartment are

        alterations, additions, improvements, or changes in the Leased apartment without, in each case, first obtaining
        the written consent of the Landlord. A consent to a particular alteration, addition, improvement, or change,
        shall not be deemed a consent to or a waiver of restrictions against alterations, additions, improvements, or
        changes for the future. All alterations, changes, and improvements built, constructed, or placed in the Leased
        dwelling of Tenant, with the exception of fixtures removable without damage to the apartment and movable
        personal property, shall, unless otherwise provided by written agreement between Landlord and Tenant, be the

                the Apartment or is part of the cause of unclean living conditions or odor.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <p><b>9. PEST EXTERMINATION AND BED BUGS. </b>Pest extermination is performed on an “as needed” basis. Extermination
        for fleas and ticks are the responsibility of the Tenant. <b>The apartment has been inspected for bed bugs prior
            to move in. </b>Landlord has implemented a comprehensive plan of action for Tenant to follow when
        encountering bed bugs. Tenant shall immediately notify the Landlord upon discovering bed bugs or the possibility
        of bed bugs. Landlord will contact a licensed pest management professional to reasonably treat infested
        apartments, for which the Tenant will be responsible for the cost. If the infestation spreads to adjacent
        apartments, the total cost will be charged to the originating apartment Leaseholder. All Tenants will be
        required to follow our treatment program in order to protect the other Tenants, family members and guests.
        Tenant shall cooperate fully with the Landlord and the pest management professional. Failure to do so will
        result in a material breach of this Lease and termination of the Tenancy.</p>

        maintain or permit to be maintained a nuisance thereon, or permit the premises to be used in an unlawful manner.

                or guest on any part of the Premises or for any damage of any property of Tenant, or Tenant’s family,
                invitees, agents or employees, or of any other occupant or guest on any part of the Premises.</li>
            <li>Tenant covenants and agrees during the term of this Lease to indemnify and save harmless Landlord
                against and from any and all claims, damages, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorney fees,
                sustained or claimed to have been sustained by any person or persons or property in, upon or about the
                Premises. The above language notwithstanding, Landlord shall remain liable for the actionable acts of
                negligence on its part, on the part of its agents or employees.

                allowed
                without written authorization. Any vehicle in violation of this agreement is subject to being towed at
                vehicle owners expense.
            </li>
            <li>Keep the Premises, including but not limited to, all plumbing fixtures, facilities and appliances, and
                any common areas and yards used by Tenant in connection with the Premises, in a clean, safe, sanitary
                and presentable condition and free of clutter. <b>Tenant shall take reasonable steps to prevent growth
                    of mold, mildew and other environmental issues. Tenant shall regularly run the climate control
                    system and regularly open the blinds to prevent growth of mold. Failure to take these reasonable
                    steps will result in cleaning fees assessed to Tenant.</b> Landlord has the option to terminate this
                Lease under paragraph <b>16. DEFAULT</b> if Tenant fails to keep the Premises in a clean, safe, sanitary
                or presentable condition as a failure of Tenant to comply with a term or condition of this Lease;</li>
            <li>Section 504.8 of the North Carolina State Fire Prevention Code prohibits the use of gas, propane,
                charcoal or wood grills within ten (10) feet of multiple housing units. Use a metal container to clean

                assessed for items that are disposed of improperly.</li>
            <li>Tenant may not park more than two vehicles on the property. Tenant must obtain written consent from
                Landlord to park more than two vehicles on the property.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <p><b>11. WAIVER BY LANDLORD. </b>WAIVER BY LANDLORD OF A BREACH OF ANY COVENANT OR DUTY OF TENANT UNDER THIS LEASE
        IS NOT A WAIVER OF A BREACH OF ANY OTHER COVENANT OR DUTY OF TENANT, OR OF ANY SUBSEQUENT BREACH OF THE SAME
        COVENANT OR DUTY.</p>
    <p><b>12. TENANT’S HOLDING OVER. </b>The parties agree that any holding over by Tenant under this Lease, without
        Landlord’s written consent, shall be a tenancy at will, which may be terminated by Landlord on 30 day notice in
        writing thereof. It is expressly agreed between the parties that the Landlord may change, whatever rate of rent
        he deems appropriate in such an instance. Landlord will notify Tenant of additional fees for a month to month
        Lease.</p>
    <p><b>13. TERMINATION OF TENANCY BY LANDLORD. </b>Inasmuch as the apartment complex is composed of numerous units,
        occupied by diverse persons, and whereas it is necessary for the Landlord to furnish to said occupants a proper
        area or environment in which to reside, now, therefore, it is expressly understood and agreed between the
        parties hereto, that if the Landlord deems it necessary to terminate this Lease in order to preserve the
        welfare, peace of mind, or the health of other Tenants in said apartment complex, Landlord shall give to Tenant
        30 days’ notice in writing that said Lease is terminated and Landlord shall have the sole right of determination
        of whether it is for the best of interest of the persons residing in said apartment complex that this Lease be
        terminated in the manner hereinbefore set out. It is understood and agreed between the parties, that upon
        termination of this Lease, under this section, the security deposit will be refunded in accordance with the
        terms of this Lease, if all other terms of the Lease have been fulfilled by the Tenant.</p>
    <p>Landlord may also have the option to terminate the Lease under <b>16. DEFAULT</b> if there is a failure to comply
        with a term or condition of this Lease. Termination under <b>16. DEFAULT</b> does not require a 30-day
        notification and may result in forfeiture of the Security Deposit.</p>
    <p><b>14. COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT AND DELIVERY OF PREMISES. </b>The Landlord covenants for the Tenant a quiet
        and peaceful possession of said premises during the term of this Lease. Also, that the Landlord is in peaceful
        possession of said premises and has good lawful right to Lease or assign same, and that the Landlord hereby
        guarantees same so long as the Tenant complies with the terms of this Lease. At the end of the term of this
        Lease, Tenant shall quit and deliver up the premises to Landlord in as good condition as they are now, ordinary
        wear, decay and damage by the elements excepted.</p>
    <p><b>Noise/Sound: </b>You agree that the concept of peaceful, safe and quiet enjoyment as defined by common law and
        N.C.G.S. Section 42 does not guarantee that the Home will be perfectly quiet, safe or peaceful and due to the
        inherent nature of multifamily living environments, You agree that certain everyday sounds such as walking,
        talking, cleaning, using common appliances and the occasional entertaining of guests at reasonable hours will
        penetrate the floors, walls and ceilings. You agree that We cannot guarantee that You will have complete quiet
        and serene living environment.</p>
    <p>
        With regard to continued and unreasonable noise by a Tenant/neighbor:
        <ol>
            <li>
                You understand and agree that We cannot attempt to file an eviction lawsuit unless certain circumstances
                are present, such as you agree to appear in court and testify as an eye witness; You or We are able to
                corroborate Your complaints with sworn testimony of at least one other neighbor or eye witness. Other
                factors may also apply and will be assessed on a case-to-case basis. You understand and agree that You
                have no legal remedy or recourse against Us if You do not fully cooperate with the lawsuit; this
                includes the right to demand that We allow You to transfer to any other rental property.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <p><b>Smoke and Odors: </b>N.C.G.S. Section 42 and/or other similar elements of common law do not impose a duty on
        Us to make the Home smoke-free or odor-free to Your satisfaction, particularly when said smoke and/or odors
        and/or smells are caused by your neighbors. Cooking smells, odors, and tobacco smoke caused by You or neighbors
        have the capability of penetrating walls, ceilings and floors, and You agree that this reality is inherent in
        any multifamily living environment. You agree that it is impossible or unreasonably practicable (due to
        extraordinary costs involved) for Us to prevent odors, smoke or other smells from entering the Home from
        neighboring rental units.</p>
    <p><b>15. FITNESS ROOM. </b>Privileges to use of the fitness room are included in your rent. Landlord reserves the
        right to revoke such privileges. In the event of revocation of privileges, no deduction in rent will occur and
        such may result in eviction and termination of the Lease.</p>

    <p><b>16. DEFAULT. </b>IF THE TENANT DEFAULTS IN THE PAYMENT OF RENT OR ANY PART THEREOF, AT THE TIMES HEREINBEFORE
        SPECIFIED, OR IF THE TENANT DEFAULTS IN THE PERFORMANCE OF OR COMPLIANCE WITH ANY OTHER TERM OF CONDITION
        HEREOF, OR OF THE REGULATIONS ATTACHED HERETO AND MADE A PART HEREOF, WHICH REGULATIONS SHALL BE SUBJECT TO
        OCCASIONAL AMENDMENT OR ADDITION BY LANDLORD, THE LEASE, AT THE OPTION OF THE LANDLORD, SHALL TERMINATE AND BE
        FORFEITED, AND LANDLORD MAY FILE A SUMMARY EJECTMENT WITH THE COUNTY MAGISTRATE’S OFFICE FOR A MONEY JUDGEMENT
        AND/OR POSSESSION OF THE PROPERTY. LANDLORD MAY RECOVER DAMAGES, INCLUDING COSTS AND ATTORNEY’S FEES FROM THE
        TENANT. It is expressly understood and agreed between the parties that in the event the Landlord is forced to
        retake possession of the apartment under this section of the Lease, that the Tenant shall not be relieved of his
        duty to pay rent as provided in this Lease; it is further understood, that the balance of the rent remaining on
        this Lease shall then immediately be due and payable to the Landlord. It is further understood and agreed
        between the parties that in the event that Lease is terminated under this section, that the security deposit
        shall immediately be forfeited to the Landlord.</p>
    <p><b>17. DESTRUCTION OF PREMISES AND EMINENT DOMAIN. </b>In the event the Leased premises are destroyed or rendered
        untenable by fire, storm, earthquake, or other casualty not caused by the negligence of the Tenant, or if the
        same are taken by eminent domain, this Lease shall be at end from such time, except for the purpose of enforcing
        rights that may have then accrued hereunder. The rental shall then be accounted for between Landlord and Tenant
        up to the time of such injury or destruction or taking of the premises. Tenant paying up to such date and
        Landlord refunding the rent collected beyond such date. Should a part only of the Leased premises be destroyed
        or rendered untenable by fire, storm, earthquake or other casualty not caused by the negligence of Tenant, the
        rental shall abate in the proportion which the injured part bears to the whole Leased premises, and such parts
        so injured shall be restored by Landlord as speedily as practicable, after which
        the full rent shall recommence and the Lease continue according to its terms. A condemnation award shall belong
        exclusively to the Landlord.
    </p>
    <p><b>18. TERMINATION OF TENANCY BY TENANT. </b>Provided neither Landlord nor Tenant wishes for the Lease to
        terminate at the end of the Lease term and a new Lease or a renewal of this Lease has not been signed, and the
        Tenant holds over ( a “holdover tenancy”), then unless otherwise notified, the Landlord and Tenant agree that
        the Lease will continue month to month at the end of the Lease period. It is further agreed the original Lease
        terms (except for this paragraph 18) will remain in effect unless amended in writing by the parties. In the case
        of a holdover tenancy, Tenant agrees to provide 60 (sixty) days written notice prior to vacating the premises at
        the end of the holdover tenancy. If the Tenant does not provide the 60 day notice prior to the last day of this
        Lease term, or the holdover tenancy (which ever applies) the Tenant will be responsible for the rent from the
        date the Landlord is notified in writing of the Tenant’s intention to vacate through the 60 (sixty) day period.
        If Tenant does not complete the term of this Lease, Tenant is responsible for the rent until the unit is
        re-rented. Tenant will be responsible for prorated turnover costs if Tenant does not fulfill the term of this
        Lease, and it is their first lease for the unit.</p>
    <p>Month to month leases (but not holdover tenancies) will continuously renew each month thereafter until Tenant or
        Landlord provide the other with a written notice of termination at least 30 (thirty) days before the end of a
        monthly renewal period. If the original term does not end on the last calendar day of a month, each subsequent
        month-to-month renewal term will be exactly 30 (thirty) days in length, beginning the first calendar day after
        the end of the original term. It is further agreed the original Lease terms will remain in effect unless amended
        by the Landlord.</p>
    <p><b>Tenant's Duties Upon Termination: </b></p>
    <p><b>19. SECURITY SYSTEM, CARBON MONOXIDE AND SMOKE DETECTOR. </b>A Security system, battery or hard wired smoke
        detector and carbon monoxide detector (carbon monoxide detectors are provided in dwellings with fireplaces, gas,
        and propane or attached garages only) are provided in the above referenced apartment for the Tenant's use. The
        systems are local sounding devices. Monitoring service for the security system is an option to the Tenant
        (monitoring fees are the responsibility of the Tenant.) <b>It is the responsibility of the Tenant to test and/or
            replace the battery and test the operation of the smoke detector and carbon monoxide detector (if
            applicable) weekly. </b>It is understood that the Landlord is not an insurer, that insurance, if any, shall
        be obtained by the Tenant. The Landlord makes no guaranty or warranty, including any implied warranty of
        merchantability or fitness, that the system or services supplied, will avert or prevent occurrences or the
        consequences therefrom, which the system or services is designed to detect. It is impractical and extremely
        difficult to fix the actual damages, if any, which may proximately result from failure on the part of the
        Landlord to perform any of its obligations hereunder. The Tenant does not desire this contract to provide for
        full liability of the Landlord and agrees that the Landlord shall be exempt from liability of loss, damage, or
        injury due directly or indirectly to occurrences, or consequences therefrom, which the services or systems are
        designed to detect or avert. In the event any person, not a party to this Agreement, shall make any claim or
        file any lawsuit against the Landlord for failure of its equipment or services in any respect, Tenant agrees to
        indemnify, defend and hold Landlord harmless from any and all such claims and lawsuits including the payment of
        all damages, expenses, costs and attorney's fees.</p>
    <p><b>20. TENANT OWNERS INSURANCE POLICY. </b>The Property Owner, Landlord and Property Manager do not carry any
        insurance to the benefit of the Tenant including but not limited to General Liability, Workers Compensation or
        Fire Insurance on the Tenant or the Tenant’s personal property. Landlord requires that the Tenant purchase a
        Tenant Owners Insurance Policy covering the Tenant for personal liability (including damage caused by water from
        Tenant’s personal washing machine and/or any devices Tenant installs or uses in the apartment which could cause
        damage to the property) and personal property. Tenant shall provide Landlord with a Certificate of Insurance
        listing Property Owner, TICON, INC., as a certificate holder or interested party. The Owner’s Name is TICON,
        INC. and shall be named as an “Additional Insured” or “Interested Party”. Minimum Liability Coverage required is
        $100,000. Proof of such is required prior to move in. TENANT ACKNOWLEDGEMENT (initial)__________</p>
    <p><b>21. BINDING EFFECT. </b>The covenants and conditions herein contained shall apply to and bind the heirs, legal
        representatives, and assigns of the parties hereto, and all covenants are to be construed as conditions of this
        Lease.</p>
    <p><b>22. MORTGAGE LENDER. </b>The apartments are financed with a mortgage lender. The mortgage lender is referred
        to as the mortgagee. Tenant agrees not to look to the mortgagee as mortgagee, mortgagee in possession, or
        successor in title to the Premises, for accountability for any security deposit required by the Landlord
        hereunder as security for the Tenant's performance of this Lease. At the option of the mortgage lender, this
        Lease may at any time during its continuation be made superior or subordinate to the lien of any one or more
        mortgages affecting the Premises.</p>
    <p><b>23. HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES. </b>Tenant agrees not to handle, store or dispose of any hazardous or toxic waste or
        substance upon the Premises which are prohibited by any federal, state or local statute, ordinance or
        regulation. Tenant hereby covenants to indemnify and hold Landlord, its successors and assigns, harmless from
        any loss, damage, claims, costs, liability or cleanup costs arising out of Tenant's use, handling, storage or
        disposal of any such hazardous or toxic wastes, constituents or substances on the Premises.</p>
    <p><b>24. COVENANTS TO RUN WITH THE LAND. </b>All covenants, agreements, stipulations, provision, conditions and
        obligations herein expressed and set forth shall extend to, bind and inure to the benefit of, as the case may
        require, the heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns of Landlord and Tenant, respectively, or
        their successors in interest, as fully as if such words were written wherever reference to Landlord and Tenant
        occurs in the Lease Agreement.</p>
    <p>Tenant hereby acknowledges receipt of a copy of said Lease and of the regulations regarding the use of said
        property.</p>

    <h1 style="text-align: center; page-break-before: always;">Renters Insurance Addendum</h1>
    <p><b>BY THIS AGREEMENT</b>, made and entered into on <b>{{LeaseStart}}</b>, is attached and serves as an addendum
        to the Lease
        dated <b>{{LeaseEnd}}</b>, for the property located at <b>{{Unit}} {{StreetName}}</b>, between
        <b>{{PropertyOwner}}</b>, hereinafter
        referred to as Landlord, and <b>{{LeaseHolders}}</b>, herein referred to as Tenant.</p>
    <p>For the duration of the Lease Agreement, Tenant is required to maintain and provide evidence of renters insurance
        (“Required insurance”). <b>Minimum coverage under Tenant’s renters insurance policy must be no less than
            $100,000 and Landlord must be named as an "interested party" on the insurance policy.</b> Tenant is required
        to furnish Landlord with evidence of Required Insurance prior to occupancy of leased premises. If at any time
        Tenant does not have such insurance, Landlord has the right to ‘force place’ replacement coverage and charge
        Tenant a fee to cover the expense for such insurance. Tenant may obtain Required Insurance from an insurance
        agent or insurance company of Tenant’s choice. If Tenant furnishes evidence of such insurance and maintains the
        insurance for the duration of the Lease Agreement, then nothing more is required.</p>
    <p>Landlord’s information should be listed on your policy as: <b>{{PropertyName}} PO Box 3687, Coppell, TX 75019</b>
    </p>
    <p>If Tenant does not maintain Required Insurance, the insurance requirement of this Lease Agreement may be
        satisfied by Landlord, who may schedule the Tenant’s unit for coverage under the Landlord-Placed Master Policy
        liability insurance(“LPMP”). The coverage provided under the LPMP will include Required Insurance coverage
        listed above. An amount equal to the total cost to the Landlord of adding Tenant’s unit to the LPMP policy shall
        be charged back to Tenant by the Landlord, or the Landlord’s authorized representative. Some important points of
        this coverage, which Tenant should understand are:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>The Landlord is the Named Insured under the LPMP. Tenant is an Additional Insured under the tenant liability
            component of the LPMP policy for liability arising from on-premises Bodily Injury and Property Damage up to
            the Limits of Liability appearing above.</li>
        <li>Landlord's property and liability insurance does not protect Tenant or Tenant's guests or invitees against
            loss or damage to personal property, or cover Tenant's liability for loss or damage caused by the actions of
            Tenant or Tenant's guests or invitees.Tenant may be liable to Landlord and others for loss or damage caused
            by the actions of Tenant or Tenant's guests or invitees. Coverage only applies to liability arising on the
            residence premises. Tenant is not insured away from the residence premises.</li>
        <li>LPMP coverage is not personal liability insurance or renters insurance. The Landlord makes no warranty or
            representation that LPMP covers the Tenant’s personal property (contents) or additional living expenses.
            Although coverage may be similar to the liability portion of a Renters Insurance Policy, the LPMP may not
            protect Tenant as if Tenant had purchased personal liability or renters insurance from an insurance agent or
            insurance company of Tenant’s choice. Certain restrictions apply.</li>
        <li>Tenant agrees to provide any information and other cooperation needed for claims to be made under the LPMP.
            Tenant understands that: (i) the liability coverage provided by this insurance policy may be less extensive
            than a personal liability insurance policy or the liability coverage afforded to the "tenant" by a renter's
            insurance policy; and (ii) this insurance policy does not include any property insurance for Tenant's
            personal property (see Section 2 above).</li>
        <li><b>The fee to cover the expense of the LPMP coverage shall be $7.00 per month,</b> and Tenant agrees to pay
            this fee to the Landlord in connection with the Landlord adding Tenant as an "additional insured" to an
            insurance policy maintained by the Landlord. </li>
        <li>Tenant must provide evidence of insurance to opt of the additional monthly amount described in Section 5 by
            providing Landlord with written proof that Tenant has purchased renter's insurance. <b>Such evidence must
                indicate that Landlord has been named as an "interested party" on the insurance policy so that Landlord
                will receive notices of the policy's pending cancellation or actual cancellation.</b> If during the
            Lease Term, Landlord has any reason to believe that Tenant's insurance has been cancelled or expired, Tenant
            shall again be required to pay the additional monthly amount in Section 5 until Tenant provides Landlord
            with evidence of replacement insurance that satisfies the requirements.</li>
        <li>Subrogation Allowed. Tenant and Landlord agree that subrogation is allowed by all parties.</li>
        <li>The LPMP is designed to fulfill the insurance requirement of the Lease Agreement. <b>Scheduling under the
                LPMP policy is not mandatory and Tenant may purchase Required Insurance from an insurance agent or
                insurance company of Tenant’s choice at any time and coverage under the LPMP policy will be immediately
                terminated.</b></li>

    <p>Tenant acknowledges that it is necessary for Tenant to provide appropriate climate control, keep the Unit clean,
        and take other measures to retard and prevent mold and mildew from accumulating for the Unit. Tenant agrees to
        clean and dust the Unit on a regular basis and to remove visible moisture accumulation on windows, walls and
        other surfaces as soon as reasonably possible. Tenant agrees not to block or cover any of the heating,
        ventilation or air conditioning ducts in the Unit. Tenant also agrees to immediately report to the management
        office: (i) any evidence of a water leak or excessive moisture in the Unit, as in any storage room, garage or
